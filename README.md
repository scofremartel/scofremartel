- Hello, I'm Sergio Cofre Martel, Mechanical Engineer and Ph.D. in Reliability Engineering.
- During my graduate studies, my research focused on machine learning and deep learning applications to prognostics and health management.
- Nowadays I work as a reliability engineer at Intuitive Surgical. So, as a discloser, all the projects that are posted here are personal, they are my own work, and they are not to be linked or related to Intuitive Surgical in any way.
- I'm seeking to create jupyter notebook files that include theory and easy-to-use python scripts on the subject of reliability. Ideally, anyone with basic knowledge on statistics, calculus, coding, and engineering should be able to understand and use these scripts for their own purposes.
